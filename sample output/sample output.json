    "summary": "  Networks built using SDN (Software-Defined Networks) and NFV (Network\nFunctions Virtualization) approaches are expected to face several challenges\nsuch as scalability, robustness and resiliency. In this paper, we propose a\nself-modeling based diagnosis to enable resilient networks in the context of\nSDN and NFV. We focus on solving two major problems: On the one hand, we lack\ntoday of a model or template that describes the managed elements in the context\nof SDN and NFV. On the other hand, the highly dynamic networks enabled by the\nsoftwarisation require the generation at runtime of a diagnosis model from\nwhich the root causes can be identified. In this paper, we propose finer\ngranular templates that do not only model network nodes but also their\nsub-components for a more detailed diagnosis suitable in the SDN and NFV\ncontext. In addition, we specify and validate a self-modeling based diagnosis\nusing Bayesian Networks. This approach differs from the state of the art in the\ndiscovery of network and service dependencies at run-time and the building of\nthe diagnosis model of any SDN infrastructure using our templates.\n",
